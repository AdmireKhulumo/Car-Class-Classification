# Car Class ML Prediction
#### *ML Classification*
 
 
## Description

This is a simple Jupyter Notebooks file where I was learning and practising machine learning classifcation. The model takes some parameters about a car and classifies its condition as unacceptable, acceptable, good or very good. The model was trained using a K-Nearest Neighbours classification algorithm.

## Future Improvements
Train another model using a different classification algorithm and compare their accuracy.
